This project is a **microservices-based e-commerce application** built with **React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and MongoDB**. It is containerized using **Docker** and deployed using **Kubernetes**.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services for **Users, Products, and Orders**.  
- **React Frontend**: A user-friendly UI for interacting with APIs.  
- **API Gateway**: Centralized communication for microservices.  
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores user, product, and order data.  
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerized and orchestrated deployment.  
- **Jenkins CI/CD**: Automates testing, building, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Installation  

📌 AWS Deployment Architecture
🛠️ AWS Services Used:
✅ EC2 – Hosts Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
✅ EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) – Orchestrates microservices.
✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) – Manages the database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL).
✅ ECR (Elastic Container Registry) – Stores Docker images.
✅ S3 – Stores frontend assets and logs.
✅ ALB (Application Load Balancer) – Manages incoming traffic.
✅ Route 53 – Handles domain and DNS.
✅ CloudWatch & Prometheus/Grafana – Monitors logs and performance.
✅ IAM Roles – Manages access control.

📌 Deployment Flow:
1️⃣ Develop & Push Code → GitHub/GitLab
2️⃣ Jenkins CI/CD on AWS EC2

Pulls code

Runs tests, SonarQube analysis

Builds & pushes Docker images to ECR
3️⃣ Deploy to AWS EKS

Kubernetes manages microservices

ALB routes traffic
4️⃣ Monitor & Scale

CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana track metrics

Auto Scaling ensures performance
